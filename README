NSCAweb is a Nagios core (tm) based monitoring solution addon which allows you to easily submit (passive) host and service checks over http(s) to the Nagios external command file.

 - Duplicate and forward passive check results to an "unlimited" amount of destinations.

 - Simultaneous local and remote delivery.
 - Each destination has an independent, dedicated thread and queue.
 - Buffering of unavailable destinations and resubmitting when destination comes available to prevent data loss.
